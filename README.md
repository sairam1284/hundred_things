## Hundred Things
---
**Background**
Ever been bored and want something interesting to fill your time with.  I know from personal experience, that looking at list of 50 things leaves me overwhelmed and I end up doing nothing.  I created this fun Ruby on Rails app where a user can click on a category and a random activity will appear.

ENJOY!
